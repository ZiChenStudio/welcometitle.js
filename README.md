# welcometitle.js

[English](./README.md)|[简体中文](./doc/README_zh-CN.md)

## What is this?

A JavaScript component that changes the title to welcome you when you leave or return to the interface.

This is not my creativity, it's just that I saw such a design on someone else's webpage, but couldn't find such a JavaScript component, so I wrote it myself.

## How to use?

Select the version you need and copy it under the `<title>` tag in your HTML document.
